# DUNE-light-sim
This software package includes all files used for light simulation for DUNE-vd. 

The fast optical simulation in DUNE-vd are using so-called hybrid model, which is the combination of semi-analytcial model (active volume --inside of the field cage) and photon library (non-active volume -- outside of the field cage)
- Semi-analytical model, see [arxiv link -- to be attached]
  - Tuturial: see this [website](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/sbn-analysis-group/wiki/Tutorial_3_Semi-Analytic_mode_How_to_generate_the_correction_curves).
